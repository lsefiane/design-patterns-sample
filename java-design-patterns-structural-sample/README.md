# Structural Design Patterns

## Adapter Pattern

- Makes existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.

## Bridge Pattern

- Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

## Composite Pattern

- Describes a group of objects that are treated the same way as a single instance of the same type of object.
